The workflow for this library should be as follows: parse
some GCode, manipulate that GCode using provided functions,
export it back into a file.

For parsing, we make no assumptions. For all intents and
purposes, the GCode file could be a single line full of
characters. This should still be able to parse fine.
In fact, the entire GCode language should just be
a regular expression, so we can step through it
characters by character like a DFA.

As for the internal structure: it is simply a list
of Commands.

A Command is a struct holding the
AtomCommand and arguments as a list of AtomCommands.
And AtomCommand is something like G1 or X20, it
is a struct with the command type and number specification.
